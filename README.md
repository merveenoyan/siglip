# SigLIP Projects

This repository shows how you can utilize [SigLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15343) for search in different modalities.

It contains:
- A notebook on how to create an embedding index using SigLIP with Hugging Face Transformers and FAISS,
- An image similarity search application that uses the created index,
- An application that compares SigLIP and CLIP.
